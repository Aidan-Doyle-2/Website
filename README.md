# Aidan.ink 🌐

Welcome to **Aidan.ink** — my digital cave, portfolio, and occasional ranting ground.  
Built using the most "powerful" and "modern" technology known to humanity: **HTML**.  
Yes, *HyperText Markup Language*, because what else screams “cutting-edge” like hand-crafting divs that refuse to center?

## 🤖 What’s Inside

- A personal website that somehow works without 47 JavaScript frameworks  
- Clean, semantic(ish) HTML with a hint of CSS chaos  
- The occasional existential `<div>` nested 14 levels deep  
- More `<br>` tags than any sane person would admit to using  

## 🧠 Why HTML?

Because:
- I enjoy pain  
- React said I needed a build pipeline just to say “Hello, world!”  
- And because HTML may be basic, but at least it **never deprecates itself every six months**

## 🚀 Plans (maybe)

One day, I might add:
- A blog about physics, quantum computing, and why CSS Grid personally offends me  
- Shiny interactive bits (once I forgive JavaScript)  
- Dark mode that actually works  

## 🧑‍💻 Author

**Aidan Doyle** — physicist, coder, and reluctant front-end developer.  
Find me at [https://aidan.ink](https://aidan.ink) before I replace this site with a single `<h1>` that says *“It works on my machine.”*
