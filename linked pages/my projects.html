        </h3>
        <p>
           Below here I will list a number of projects that I have undertaken over the last few years. Firstly
           I will list the number of academic projects I have undertaken during my undergraduate degree and now
           in my masters. This ranges from predicting modeling of an Earth-Jupiter-Sun system to lattice simulation
           to find an optimal lattice constant. Then after that I will list a few personal projects that I have
           completed, and maybe a few that are still a working progress.

            <b><i>Description:</i></b> In our brief for this project we were given two equations of motion
            for the original 2-body problem, where we would replicate the motion of the planets around a 
            stationary object using Runge-Kutta integration (Earth-Sun and Jupiter-Sun). We were then given 
            four more equations of motion, which once integrated would yield an effective three body system.
            <br>
            <b><i>Abstract:</i></b> In this project we investigate the Earth-Jupiter-Sun System and observe the effect Jupiter has on
            Earth’s orbit. We do this by plotting two separate 2-body problems (Earth-Sun, Jupiter-Sun)
            so we can analyse the effects on Earth’s orbit when we plot the 3-body problem. Mainly the
            changes in the perihelion/aphelion positions and also calculating the semimajor axis of the
            orbit and what effect that has on the eccentricity of the orbit.

        <p>This is going to be a little website I build for my own entertainment. 
            <br>
            My aim is for this to include multiple sections with a menu which will link to each of them.
            <br> 
            I intend to be able to upload my notes here, 
            have links to my two dissertation project and create a rotating website with my gym workouts on them
