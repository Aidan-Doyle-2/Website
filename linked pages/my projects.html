                Below here I will list a number of projects that I have undertaken over the last few years. 
                Firstly I will list the number of academic projects I have undertaken during my undergraduate 
                degree and now in my masters. This ranges from predicting modeling of an Earth-Jupiter-Sun system 
                to lattice simulation to find an optimal lattice constant. Then after that I will list a few 
                personal projects that I have completed, and maybe a few that are still a work in progress.

                <h3>Gravitational Interactions in the Earth-Jupiter-Sun System</h3>
                <p>
                    <b><i>Description:</i></b> This project investigated how the gravitational influence of Jupiter affects Earth's orbit around the Sun. 
                    Using Python and numerical integration methods (Runge-Kutta and SciPy's <code>odeint</code>), we modeled two separate two-body 
                    systems before combining them into a full three-body simulation. By varying initial velocities and mass parameters, we examined 
                    how Jupiter's gravitational pull perturbs Earth's orbital shape, eccentricity, and semi-major axis over long timescales. 
                    The resulting plots and animations visualize orbital precession and instability, demonstrating the challenges of modeling 
                    non-linear celestial systems where no analytic solution exists.

                    could have formed so early in the universe. Using analytical models and Python simulations, we studied how black hole seeds grow 
                    under different physical conditions, focusing on factors like gas density, seed mass, and angular momentum. By combining these effects, 
                    we identified regions in parameter space where growth becomes highly efficient and compared them with current JWST detections.

                <p>
                    The simulations, created with NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, reproduced the theoretical conditions for optimal accretion and tracked 
                    black hole growth over time. We then mapped real JWST black hole data onto these models, showing which observations fit within the 
                    predicted high-efficiency growth zone and which appear to exceed current theoretical limits.

                <h3>Optimizing Lattice Constants for FCC Metals using Lennard-Jones Potentials</h3>
                <p>
                    <b><i>Description:</i></b> In this project I reproduced results from 
                    <i>Kanhaiya et al. (2021)</i>, which derived 
                    Lennard-Jones parameters capable of describing elastic and structural properties 
                    for a range of face-centred cubic metals. Using Python, I simulated ten FCC metals 
                    and iron to determine their equilibrium lattice constants by minimizing the total 
                    potential energy per atom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I first verified the model on Argon using the standard 12-6 Lennard-Jones potential, 
                    confirming that the minimization correctly predicts the equilibrium spacing of a simple 
                    system. The main part of the project then extended this to the 9-6 potential, which better 
                    approximates metallic bonding. I generated periodic FCC supercells, calculated pairwise 
                    atomic interactions within a cutoff radius, and applied the Nelder-Mead optimization 
                    algorithm to locate the minimum-energy lattice constant for each element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The calculated values were compared to experimental lattice parameters, showing good agreement 
                    and validating the ability of the Lennard-Jones potential to capture key trends in metallic 
                    bonding despite its simplicity. This work provided practical insight into how interatomic 
                    potentials can be used to model and understand bulk metallic systems at the atomistic level.

                <h3>Predicting Potential Energies for Water Molecules using Neural Networks</h3>
                <p>
                    <b><i>Description:</i></b> This project explores how a neural network can learn to predict the potential energy 
                    of water molecules directly from their atomic coordinates. Using TensorFlow and Keras, the model was trained 
                    to map molecular geometry to total energy, bridging quantum chemistry and modern machine learning techniques.

                <p>
                    The dataset included rotated and unrotated configurations of H₂O, with total energies provided in 
                    <code>.ENER</code> files. After preprocessing and feature scaling, a feed-forward neural network with two 
                    hidden layers of 64 neurons (ReLU activation) was trained using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss. 
                    Early stopping was implemented to ensure stable convergence and prevent overfitting.

            <h3>Optimising Quantum Gate Fidelity in Non-Markovian Open Systems</h3>
            <p>
                This research project formed the basis of my Master's thesis, where I investigated how quantum gates can be 
                executed reliably in open systems that interact with an environment. In realistic quantum devices, these 
                interactions lead to decoherence — the gradual loss of quantum information. However, when the environment 
                retains memory of past interactions, known as <i>non-Markovian dynamics</i>, lost information can temporarily 
                flow back into the system, potentially improving gate performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                The work focused on building and simulating open quantum systems using the <b>OQuPy</b> framework 
                (Open Quantum Python), a package that enables process-tensor-based simulations of non-Markovian dynamics. 
                My goal was to reconstruct the effective quantum channel produced by a time-dependent Hamiltonian, compare it 
                against a target unitary gate, and measure the resulting gate fidelity. 
            </p>

            <div class="masters-text">
                <p>
                    To achieve this, I evolved a complete basis of input density matrices through the simulated dynamics to 
                    reconstruct the system's <i>superoperator</i>. This operator fully describes how any quantum state transforms 
                    over time. The superoperator was then reshaped into a <i>Choi matrix</i>, a representation that preserves 
                    both input and output correlations and allows extraction of <i>Kraus operators</i> — the key mathematical objects 
                    that describe how noise acts on the system. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    By performing an eigendecomposition of the Choi matrix, I derived the Kraus operators numerically and computed 
                    the <b>average gate fidelity</b> by comparing the noisy channel to an ideal target gate. This process, based on 
                    the formalism outlined in <i>Wood et al. (2022)</i> and <i>Pedersen et al. (2007)</i>, provided a robust way to 
                    quantify how closely real open-system dynamics can reproduce ideal quantum logic.

                <p>
                    The core of the simulation relied on the <b>process tensor</b> — a higher-order object that encodes the influence 
                    of the environment across multiple timesteps. Each tensor index represents a past system-environment interaction, 
                    meaning that past control actions can directly influence future evolution. This framework allowed me to capture 
                    memory effects that are invisible in traditional Markovian master equations. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using this approach, I simulated systems under both Markovian and non-Markovian conditions by varying the bath 
                    correlation time parameter. The results revealed that as the environment's memory length increases, coherence 
                    revivals begin to emerge, producing oscillatory behaviour in the fidelity. This confirmed that non-Markovianity 
                    enables partial recovery of information lost to the environment.

                    The fidelity plots below compare quantum gate performance under different environmental models. 
                    The orange curve shows a Markovian regime, where fidelity decays monotonically due to irreversible 
                    decoherence. The green curve, corresponding to a non-Markovian regime, shows clear oscillations — 
                    a signature of information backflow. This behaviour highlights the potential to use environmental 
                    memory as a stabilising resource in quantum computation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, I implemented a simple form of control optimisation, tuning the system Hamiltonian parameters 
                    to minimise fidelity loss over time. These optimised simulations achieved near-unit fidelity for short 
                    timescales, demonstrating how non-Markovian feedback can be harnessed to enhance quantum gate robustness.

                <p>
                    <i>Currently in development,</i> this cross-platform mobile app is being built to simplify how hockey clubs 
                    schedule, track, and manage their coaching hours. Designed initially for my own club, it aims to replace 
                    outdated spreadsheets with a streamlined digital platform that integrates scheduling, hour logging, and 
                    invoicing in one place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app allows clubs to assign coaches to specific sessions, view real-time availability, and automatically 
                    calculate hours worked for invoicing — reducing administrative work and minimizing scheduling errors. 
                    Coaches can log in to see their weekly schedule, track accumulated hours, and manage payments directly

                    my experience as a hockey coach, creating a tool that serves both the technical and sporting communities.

                <h3>Quantum Gate Simulator – Building Quantum Circuits in C++</h3>
                <p>
                    The Quantum Gate Simulator is a compact C++ program built to model the fundamentals of quantum computation 
                    from the ground up. It lets users assemble and execute simple quantum circuits directly from the command line 
                    using gates such as Pauli-X, Y, Z, Hadamard, Phase, and CNOT.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each qubit is represented as a complex-valued vector, and gates are treated as unitary matrices. 
                    State evolution is handled through matrix–vector multiplication with normalization and probability tracking 
                    after every operation. Commands like:

                <p style="font-family: monospace; background: #f4f4f4; padding: 8px; border-radius: 6px;">
                    ./quantum_sim.exe --circuit "H CNOT" --two-qubits
                </p>
                <p>
                    prepare a maximally entangled Bell state — a clean demonstration of quantum superposition and entanglement 
                    handled entirely in C++. The codebase follows an industry-style layout with <code>src/</code> and 
                    <code>include/</code> directories, a Makefile for compilation, and a modular object-oriented design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The simulator serves as both a learning tool and a coding exercise in low-level quantum logic simulation. 
                    Planned updates include Bloch sphere visualization, measurement statistics, and unit testing with Catch2.
