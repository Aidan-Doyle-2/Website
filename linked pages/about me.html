            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p>My name is Aidan Doyle and I am the creator of this website. I designed this
               website because I was bored over summer. If I ever get to it there will be a
               photo of myself next to this to show you who I am.</p>

            <p>I have put my emails up on this page for work/study related reasons, however
               if you don't have my phone number or you are not emailing for an
               interview/job/teaching-position then please do not contact me.</p>

            <p>I am currently studying in Trinity College Dublin and a recent graduate of
               Maynooth University. My main hobbies include playing Hockey, currently at
               Rathgar Hockey Club, and going to the gym. I also play too much golf for my
               own good. Wicklow Golf Club is where I am currently a member and it is one
               of the most pristine courses in the country. It also has one of the best
               young-adult membership deals I could find so I would suggest joining.</p>

            <p>Card collecting is another one of my crippling addictions. It started
               originally with Pok√©mon cards, which led me to collect a full set of the
               original base set, among many more. Recently I have become quite fond of
               Magic The Gathering and this has led me to invest more of my money into this
               pit.</p>

            <p>That pretty much covers it all, but if you're bothered to read the rest of
               this page it will go into more detail.</p>

            <h3>My Undergraduate Degree</h3>
            <p>I recently graduated from my undergraduate degree (BSc) Theoretical Physics &
               Mathematics with a 2.1 second class honors. Graduating with a tiny class of
               only 10 people, I am very grateful to Maynooth University for providing such
               a unique course which cannot be found anywhere else in Ireland.</p>

            <p>The degree (course code MH206) comprises of a 50/50 split between Theoretical
               Physics and Pure Mathematics. It starts off incredibly difficult, thrusting
               students into second and third year modules with the expectation that there
               will be significant self study done to catch up.
               <b>If you are looking for a fun freshers week don't do this course.</b></p>

            <p>In my personal experience, as you spend most of first year trying to catch
               up, there is little time to actually gain an understanding of the concepts
               taught. I felt almost forced to learn off how to use the formulas and do
               calculations to keep pace, and that was to my detriment in later years of the
               degree.</p>

            <p>In the physics side we learned things such as the basics of ODEs, Quantum
               Mechanics 1 & 2, Electromagnetism and Cosmology. The Theoretical Physics
               department in particular was incredibly helpful during our studies, providing
               us with any assistance we needed.</p>

            <p>The Mathematics part of the degree walked us through topics like Euclidian
               Geometry, Real and Complex Analysis and Topology. For anyone looking to study
               Pure Mathematics out of secondary school, I would make sure you do your
               research thoroughly. Pure Mathematics is nothing like the Maths you do in
               school, and is far more proof orientated, with many wordy demonstrations
               required on assignments.</p>
