        <p>
            My name is Aidan Doyle and I am the creator of this website. I designed this website because
            I was bored over summer. If I ever get too it there will be a photo of myself next to this
            to show you who I am. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I have put my emails up on this page for work/study related reasons, however if you don't
            have my phone number or you are not emailing for a interview/job/teaching-position 
            then please do not contact me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently studying in Trinity College Dublin and a recent graduate of Maynooth 
            University. My main hobbies include playing Hockey, currently at Rathgar Hockey Club, 
            and going to the gym. I also play for too much golf for my own good. Wicklow Golf 
            club is where I am currently a member and it is one of the most pristine courses in the 
            country. It also has one of the best young-adult membership deals I could find so I would
            suggest joining.

            Card collecting is another one of my crippling addictions. It started originally with Pokemon
            cards, which had lead me to collect a full set of the original base set, among many more. 
            Recently have I become quite fond of Magic The Gathering and this has lead me to invest more
            of my money into this pit.

            That pretty much covers it all, but if you're bothered to read the rest of this page 
            will go into more detail.

            My Undergraduate Degree
        </h3>
        <p>
            I recently graduated from my undergraduate degree (BSc) Theoretical Physics & Mathematics
            with a 2.1 second class honors. Graduating with a tiny class of only 10 people, I am 
            very grateful to Maynooth University for providing such a unique course which cannot be
            found anywhere else in Ireland.
        </p>
        <p>
            The degree (course code MH206) comprises of a 50/50 split between Theoretical Physics 
            and pure Mathematics. It starts off incredibly difficult, thrusting students into second
            third year module with the expectation that there will be significant self study done to
            catch up.
            <b>If you are looking for a fun freshers week don't do this course.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            In my personal experience, as you spend most of first year trying to catch up, there is
            little time to actually gain an understanding of the concepts taught. I felt almost 
            forced to learn off how to use the formula's and do calculations to keep pace, and that
            was to my detriment in later years of the degree.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the physics side we learned things such as the basics of doing ODE's, Quantum
            Mechanics 1&2, Electromagnetism and Cosmology. The Theoretical Physics department in 
            particular was incredibly helpful during our studies, providing us with any assistance we
            needed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Mathematics part of the degree walked us through topics like Euclidian Geometry, Real 
            and Complex Analysis and Topology. For anyone looking to study Pure Mathematics out of 
            secondary school, I would make sure you do your research thoroughly. Pure Mathematics is 
            nothing like the Maths you do in school, and is far more proof orientated, with many wordy
            demonstrations required on assignments.
